I'm a Polyglot Software Engineer with 4+ years of professional experience with my primary focus in frontend development (Mobile & Web). 

My experience is not only limited to working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Next.js, Remix, Node, GraphQL, and gRPC.

I also possess deep technical expertise across the full stack building Microservices, Distributed, Cloud Native, Serverless, Event-Driven Systems, Edge Computing(Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify), Networking Protocols(HTTP/2 / HTTP/3 / TCP/UDP), and frameworks (gRPC, GraphQL, REST).

Building cross-platform mobile apps right now - Android & iOS using React Native, State Machines, Rxjs, and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

I'm a constant learner and love to build side projects using cutting-edge toolsets adapting to the ever-changing landscape.

I love functional programming and am a strong advocate for the adoption of strongly typed functional programming languages; with referential transparency, and immutability, it’s become possible to build very declarative, composable - (functions being the first citizens!), highly concurrent, and easier to reason about applications.

I also love music, photography, and the great outdoors.
